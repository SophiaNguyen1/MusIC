MusIC
-----
This project converts an image of sheet music into an audio format (WAV) which can be played directly from a Raspberry Pi.

It is integrated with Cal Pratt's [SheetVision](https://github.com/cal-pratt/SheetVision) to obtain a MIDI file from an image of sheet music, and the program either parses a MusicXML file or a MIDI file to a playable WAV file. This WAV file is automatically played through the Raspberry Pi, successfully playing the notes from the sheet music.
